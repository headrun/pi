There are 3 Million people in Telecom on Linkedin and over 1,000 groups. In November, 2008. We brought together about 100 Open Networkers and Group Managers to try something different and better. Nearly 55,000 telecom professionals have joined one or more of our 10 CrossConnects groups, including four geographically aligned groups for Sales Professionals. Telecom Tigers is our Flagship group with over 30,000 members We started with simple goals: Operating with integrity and transparency, • Enhancing and accelerating the ability of professionals like you to connect with a larger network of peers. • Maintaining a fidelity to the Telecom and Wireless industries • Developing the trust of the Group Manager community here on LinkedIn. The CrossConnects movement is far from the largest telecom group on LinkedIn; that has never been our motivation. We are premised on the belief that in this economic environment you need to be as visible as possible and that a solid, forward looking community is necessary to achieve those ends. To join this group you must be in the telecommunications, telephony, or mobile industry. Happy Networking!

There are 3 Million people in Telecom on Linkedin and over 1,000 groups. In November, 2008. We brought together about 100 Open Networkers and Group Managers to try something different and better. Nearly 55,000 telecom professionals have joined one or more of our 10 CrossConnects groups, including four geographically aligned groups for Sales Professionals. Telecom Tigers is our Flagship group with over 30,000 members We started with simple goals: Operating with integrity and transparency, • Enhancing and accelerating the ability of professionals like you to connect with a larger network of peers. • Maintaining a fidelity to the Telecom and Wireless industries • Developing the trust of the Group Manager community here on LinkedIn. The CrossConnects movement is far from the largest telecom group on LinkedIn; that has never been our motivation. We are premised on the belief that in this economic environment you need to be as visible as possible and that a solid, forward looking community is necessary to achieve those ends. To join this group you must be in the telecommunications, telephony, or mobile industry. Happy Networking!
