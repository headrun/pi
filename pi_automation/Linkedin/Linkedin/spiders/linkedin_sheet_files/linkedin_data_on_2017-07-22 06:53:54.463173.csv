He has the distinction of being awarded the Doctoral Degree - Ph.D. in Political Science for his thesis titled ‚ÄúWomen's Participation in the Panchayat Raj.‚Äù His relentless service in the realm of youth and social empowerment saw fruition when he was awarded the prestigious Eisenhower Fellowship from the Eisenhower Foundation, Philadelphia, U.S.A. The foundation was headed by the American President George HW Bush. He was one of the architects of the ambitious rural welfare scheme called CSCs (Common Service Centers) of Govt. of India which resulted in the creation of 10 million jobs for rural youth. He proposed a project ‚ÄúRajiv Vikas Kendra‚Äù to the Government of India through Hon'ble Congress President Smt. Sonia Gandhi, which was forwarded to the then Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. This proposal was accepted and approved by the Union Cabinet as the CSCs on September 2006, with a total project outlay of Rs. 5743cores. A born leader, his skills were honed in the early student days of school and college and opened up vast avenues for him to be recognized as a leader and thereby counted among the youth as a youth icon on the global platform. He is deeply involved in Indian Politics for more than three and half decades. At present, he is the member of the highest decision making body of the party; the All India Congress Committee, New Delhi. Manjunath Bhandary is actively engaged in the Congress Party's Student and Youth movement.",500,Political Organization,"Shivamoga, Karnataka,
