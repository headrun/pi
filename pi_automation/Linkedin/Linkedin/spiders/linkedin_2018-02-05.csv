Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. The term “Internet of Things” was first documented by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, in 1999. Typically, IoT is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications. The interconnection of these embedded devices (including smart objects), is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields, while also enabling advanced applications like a Smart Grid. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4435310&goback=, group_name:-IoT Trends, no_of_members:-1793, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/AAEAAQAAAAAAAALfAAAAJDk1NWFlZDJhLTBlYzEtNDY1ZS05MzZkLTI1N2I3NTQ0YjdiYQ.png, group_id:-4435310, group_description:-Group managed by IoT Evolution.

I wrote a post in early 2013 entitled “3 Stunningly Good LinkedIn Profile Summaries.” This post went viral and is a top google search result for ""LinkedIn Summary Examples"" - it's been shared by over 2,500 people! I basically wrote the book on how to write an authentic, engaging and powerful LinkedIn Summary. Here’s a link to that incredibly popular post: “3 Stunningly Good LinkedIn Profile Summaries.” http://bit.ly/3stunninglygoodsummaries How does your Summary compare to the 3 real life examples I wrote about? If you need help with your Summary, Profile or strategy on LinkedIn, please get in touch: linkedinsights@gmail.com or 773.469.6600 Andy Foote LinkedIn Author & Coach blog: www.linkedinsights.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,HCL,,GM,,,,,,114849608,,,NeST,,SBU Head,1996,2004,,,,152357392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Set apart from the traditional code-filled technical journals for rank-and-file programmers, SD Times was written from the beginning for the programmer’s boss, the development manager. And in a world where any programmer can search online for any technical tip or trick they want, SD Times’ coverage of what’s happening and what it means endures in print as the No. 1 publication in the software development market. More companies run more ad pages in SD Times than any other developer title (source: IMS: The Auditor). SD Times began reaching 40,000 software development managers, but has expanded carefully over the years and now reaches more than 600,000 project leaders, architects and development managers in 119 countries monthly. Now published monthly, SD Times brings the kind of in-depth reviews of the critical issues facing development management along with traditional original reporting of the news often missed by the broad-based IT industry press—information critical to our readers. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2219335&goback=, group_name:-Salesforce Professionals, no_of_members:-22393, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/p/1/000/02f/233/0c528cb.png, group_id:-2219335, group_description:-Salesforce Professionals Network <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=6772400&goback=, group_name:-Salesforce Remote / Part Time Projects, no_of_members:-1245, group_id:-6772400, group_description:-With the Salesforce demand in the market, it is important to form a group that can share the small scale projects which requires occasional help with specific experience integrating Salesforce for various business applications.

The advent of the recurring-revenue business model has had profound impacts, and the effects of the change are far from being over. While companies continue the race to gain market share and to fight off competitors in acquiring as many new customers as possible in the shortest amount of time, it’s what happens **after** the initial contract is signed that will be the critical factor of long-term corporate success. Both parties to the subscription agreement make significant investments; the vendor to acquire the customer, the customer to learn and adopt the application -- and neither party profits unless the relationship continues and extends. Sales is an art and a science. So is what comes after, the continuance and deepening of the customer relationship. Service, Support, Satisfaction -- and the ultimate factor of retention: Customer Success. A new era has begun; it’s time for a new approach. The purpose of the group is to discuss the strategy and tactics of retaining customer relationships by enhancing the productivity and profitability of both parties. Sometimes that will involve details of Customer Service, or Customer Support issues or ways to measure and increase customer Satisfaction. All of these are pieces of the larger puzzle. The audience of The Customer Success Forum is CxO's and CS leaders at all levels, and membership is open to all interested professionals. The Customer Success Forum is a part of the Customer Success Association, which offers a variety of resources for customer relationship management and optimization.

We do however showcase jobs across the globe on a central user-friendly careers network. We are dedicated to providing the best employment opportunities for professional and experienced expatriates or for those simply wishing to relocate within their home country or overseas. We have ambitious plans for the future to ensure we continue to expand our services to meet the full scope of needs of international employers and expatriates across the globe. Significant time is devoted to researching expatriate resources to assist you with becoming an expatriate. We continue to advertise globally and expand our marketing campaigns to ensure we are the leader in expatriate job advertisements. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=51584&goback=, group_name:-Grant Thornton Executive Search, no_of_members:-52841, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAflAAAAJDkyYTMzZWVlLTVmZjEtNGVlMi04MTI4LWQ1MzkxOTM4MjEwMA.png, group_id:-51584, group_description:-As a multi-specialist we focus on strategic recruitment for positions where leadership and management skills are required.

It's interesting to see architecture discipline moving to mainstream. In the last decade, the discussions which started to define architect as mathematician, philosopher, military planner etc..is slowly giving way to ""how to apply theories of complexity to modern business and systems"". The idea is simply to connect aspiring & practicing architects (CEO, CIO, CTO, Chief Architects, VP / Director IT, Managers, Architects),so that the enormous volume of communication can be replaced with the wisdom and guidance of quick & practical, easy-to-understand ideas which could help you to manage change & complexity better.

Approximately 40% of internet users in India have admitted to visiting a gambling site - but not placing a bet. The Indian gambling market is estimated to be worth US$60 billion per year, of which about half is illegally bet. According to the Indian National Newspaper, the Chief Executive officer for the International Cricket Council (ICC) said he was in favour of legalizing sports betting. He believes the illegal funds profited are through underground bookies that used the money to fund terrorism and drugs. Online gambling is in its infancy in India, but Sikkim will be the first state to start sports betting through betting shops in 2015/2016. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=8209939&goback=, group_name:-Udacity Alumni Network, no_of_members:-5936, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/AAMABACJAAIAAQAAAAAAAA9cAAAAJDhiNmVjODExLWE5NDYtNDEyMi1hMWZmLWVhZGU3MDkzMjUwNA.png, group_id:-8209939, group_description:-Your Nanodegree may be over, but the journey is just beginning.

We were managing a site that generated revenues in excess of a billion dollars a year, and Binand was the overall incharge of designing and managing the hardware and servers. There was never a problem that he could not solve and that also in good time. The other thing that impressed me was his constant endeavor to optimize and make processes/work more efficient. No wonder he could manage 3 datacenters with 500+ servers single handedly (when situation demanded or when we had a huge problem). I recommend Binand very highly, and would be delighted to have him on any team going forward. On a personal side, though sometimes he gives you a feeling of being a Network genius (read geek), he is very well read and enjoys quizzing and all other mental games. A fun guy to be with.","skill_name:-Business Intelligence, endoresement_count:-55, member_topic_skill_url:-https://www.linkedin.com/topic/business-intelligence?trk=mprofile_topic,

Challenges around how to increase efficiency, deliver enhanced citizen services and improve programs outcomes have always existed, but the technology available now gives leaders in all industries, including government the ability to augment human capabilities, in uncovering insights, predicting outcomes and making evidence based decisions at scale and at speed. The cognitive era will transform the way government agencies operate, enabling them to deepen the engagement with citizens and interactions can be personalized and tailored to the needs of the individual. Government in the Cognitive Era is the place where conversations between thought leaders, inspiring thinkers and city officials and governments around the globe are encouraged. It is a place where people can connect to share ideas and explore how to make the way we live and work better. Together we can discover ways in which the organizations across the globe focused on citizen-centric services can use technology to help decipher all the data to address the challenges of today and prepare for tomorrow. We will be posting case studies, white papers, interviews and a whole raft of materials that show the efforts being made along the cognitive journey for companies, industries, and governments as they develop digital strategies that deploy analytics, cloud, mobile, security, Internet of Things to address their challenges head on - turning data into insights, enhancing program outcomes, mitigating threats and most importantly improving the quality of life for the citizens and communities they serve.

Until last year, I have been Angie's immediate supervisor. I found her to be a high performer, hard working, tackling all assignments with dedication and commitment. Angie is a take-charge person who is able to present creative ideas and communicate the benefits. She has successfully developed several strategy and project plans for Tradepaq TRM that have resulted in increased customer satisfaction and revenue. She had good talent in articulating solutions that won many new product deals and as well expanding foot print in current accounts. Though she was an asset to our delivery efforts, Angie was also extraordinarily helpful in other areas of the company.

People are Idea Generators. People have the intelligence and the ability to fully participate in the improvement process. Instead of management always telling people what to do, through Quick and Easy Kaizen managers let their employees know what they want to accomplish and then simply ask the workers ""What do you think?"" ""How would you improve customer service?"" How would you improve quality and safety?"" A new dynamic takes place as people are empowered to serve themselves and their customers. The world is shrinking and becoming more competitive. Internet and modern technology requires companies to harness all of their resources. People have a fundamental right to human dignity and to enhance their human value. Quick and Easy Kaizen is a process where the worker is asked to participate in the improvement process through identifying problems and coming up with simple solutions that they themselves can implement. It is a very powerful motivator and it works! It works very well. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2901&goback=, group_name:-Relevante Networking Group, no_of_members:-53181, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/p/5/005/0a9/17d/11eecf4.png, group_id:-2901, group_description:-Welcome to the Relevante group on LinkedIn.

Anbu gave me good suggestions on how to modify the furniture arrangements, what should I display, what items need to be removed and so on. To my surprise, the first client he brought in accepted to rent the flat. More important was the follow-up after renting out. I was overseas for a year and during this period, Anbu was in constant touch with me through e-mails. He checked my snail mail box regularly and sent scanned documents, if they are important. Took care of HDB's requirements. Promptly deposited the rent to my bank account. When I informed him that I wanted my flat back after one year, he helped me to vacate the flat.

Before donning the robes as a lawyer in the Madras High Court where I specialise in Media, Criminal, Constitutional, Corporate, Arbitration & Consumer Cases representing celebrity clients, I was the face of NDTV in South India as the Bureau Chief & Resident Editor of NDTV 24x7 & the Executive Editor of NDTV Hindu. During my stint with NDTV 24x7, I interviewed Presidents & Prime Ministers, Chief Ministers & Governors, Diplomats, Bureaucrats, International Sportspersons, Film Stars & covered 4 Parliamentary Elections, 4 Assembly Polls, Natural Disasters, Bomb Blasts,Assassination Attempts,Sensational Arrests & Court Trials, Narcotics Smuggling & Sting Operations, some of which resulted in CBI probes. I also anchored Prime Time News Bulletins like Southern Edition, Good Morning Chennai & Lunchtime News. At NDTV Hindu, I spearheaded the telecast of 17 news bulletins a day & hosted shows like 'Chennai Speaks Out', 'Corridors of Power', 'Voice of Chennai', 'The Big Question' & 'Enterprising Entrepreneurs'. I have straddled every form of the media - TV, Print, Radio & Online. I wear many hats - as a Columnist for Deccan Chronicle & Ritz, Moderator of Shows on Chennai Live 104.8 FM, Author of the Bestselling Books ‘Speakers Are Made Not Born’ & 'Justice For All', Mentor of the Silver Tongue Academy Resource & Covenant Media. I'm a former National Debating Champion with a record 106 victories in inter-collegiate debates. Having won landmark cases in Court, I was selected by the US Govt to represent India in the International Visitors Leadership Program (IVLP) on the 'Rule of Law & Judicial Reforms' in Feb'14 in the U.S.A. A Moderator at Panel Discussions,I'm a regular speaker on prime time debates on news channels.

But then Sriram Ayer, quite like the title of that old Tamil hit film 'Aayirathil Oruvan' (meaning ""One In A Thousand"") is such a multi-faceted and versatile personality, who is sought after by business tycoons, political leaders and the highest echelons in the bureaucracy for his acumen and perspective. Be it sniffing out business opportunities or forging strategic partnerships or feeling the pulse of voters at election time, or lending his expertise in cyber security, Sriram has been the most reliable and credible 'Go To' professional in South India with his footprint overseas. Having known him for more than two decades, right from his Loyola College years, in my capacity as a Television Journalist & Editor at NDTV and later as a Lawyer, Columnist & Author, he has always struck me as an exceptionally brilliant person from an eminent family who earned his spurs on his own steam. It would be no exaggeration to call him a walking encyclopedia with an eye for detail, an ear to the ground and a nose for innovation. On the personal front, he has been a dear friend whom I can always count on. True to its name - 'Launchpad Ventures', Sriram's brainchild is poised to give your business or investment or tie up, not just a fillip but the Midas Touch.

When ‘People’ top your list of interests, you’re probably cut out to be a good politician or a HR professional! Sucheta Shetty chose the challenge of proving that the work place can be a place for happy campers sans ‘office politics’! In India Inc where the very mention of ‘HR’ can sometimes conjure up a fear psychosis of sorts and even have cynics hurl sobriquets like ‘the dirty tricks department’, this Vice President - HR of TAKE Solutions, comes across as an affable leader who is known to lead by example. The HR industry grapevine has it that this soft spoken head honcho’s penchant for “employee engagement and best practices” has made her quite the “darling of her team” and a respected and much sought after expert. Whether it is scouting for the right talent or keeping the flock together by making her colleagues feel part of the furniture; what with attrition shooting up like the proverbial Jack’s beanstalk, Sucheta goes about her business in an inimitable style and with considerable professional elan. A few months ago, Sucheta was a panelist on one of my talk shows. More than her intellectual prowess and mastery of the HR related subject or her credibility or her quick witted repartees, what struck me was her genuine warmth and mild mannered, genteel nature that provoked me to send her this text message after the show “sometimes when you meet people for the first time, you feel like you’ve met them before!” I later guessed that her inter personal skills and the immense value she places in human resources probably stem from the Advaita philosophy – ‘there is divinity in everyone’, gleaned from the spiritual books that she is an avid reader of. A little birdie reveals that Sucheta’s style of functioning is a reflection of the dictum ‘it’s not your position but your disposition that matters’. No wonder she is looked up to as a role model and not a ‘boss’. Here’s hoping she never changes!

Her hop, skip and jump from college to a 24 hour news room was marked by an incredible degree of screen presence, professionalism and maturity, far beyond her years. Evelyn has been with NDTV HINDU since its inception; her baby steps in the field coinciding with the channel’s; and soon giving way to confident strides. Over the last three years, Evelyn emerged as one of our best anchors. Whether it was feeling the pulse of the youth – through her weekly campus discussion ‘U Special’ or delving deep into contentious issues - like the Uniform Syllabus, Infighting in the Tamil Nadu Congress or the pulls and pressures of forming Team India before the World Cup, Evelyn always came across as a natural television anchor. Not content with merely powdering her nose to anchor from an air conditioned studio, Evelyn earned the spurs on the field as well – covering hard news stories like the swine flu outbreak, music maestro A. R. Rahman’s Hollywood stint, business developments, trends – from the Great Gold Rush to the very latest in real estate and the hospitality boom, not to mention her focus on the Union Budget and tours of US warships. A team player to the core, Evelyn pitched in with the production of our Year Ender Shows (the bloopers too!) and the NDTV HINDU Lifestyle Awards.

I have known Satish Kumar A Srinivasan for over two years on two related software development projects at Visa. Satish was the software development team lead and a principal software architect of Visa’s subcontracted Indian development teams for those projects. In those roles he led groups of up to 15 software developers with the task of implementing complex business requirements, use cases, and high-level design documents from design to delivery of deployable, fully compliant executables and related artifacts, on time and on budget. Satish specializes in the design and implementation of web applications and web services. His expertise includes in-depth knowledge of modern development processes and techniques, languages, browsers, numerous open source tools, database management systems, development IDEs, hardware infrastructures, security paradigms, design patterns, etc. This broad expertise proved invaluable on numerous occasions when Satish recommended innovative design concepts for complicated software components that had not occurred to in-house Visa architects. These design approaches saved Visa many development man-hours and thousands in development costs, with attendant schedule improvements. However Satish’s value goes beyond the technical accomplishments of an experienced engineer/architect. Visa projects are developed under very aggressive schedules to coincide with Visa’s yearly business cycle. Like all development teams, offshore programmers vary in skills and experience. By both example and encouragement, Satish expertly mentored his charges through a lot of late night sessions to meet deadlines in time zones far from his own. With superior language skills and an evenhanded temperament, Satish was able to communicate complex technical issues with onshore engineers and managers, and he negotiated excellent compromise solutions for many thorny technical problems. Visa is notorious for enhancing requirements while development is ongoing. Satish deftly changed gears on more than one occasion during these projects, demonstrating a unique combination of both technical and personal skills. Somehow he always got the job done, often more skillfully than I myself could do. I can frankly say that my job was made a lot easier by his patient, intelligent interactions with both managers and subordinates. I highly recommend Satish Kumar A Srinivasan.

The Forum aims to be a space where careers specialists can exchange thinking on best practice, pass on news and information, ask questions and seek resources, and - above all else - share experiences and learning. The Forum aims to provide cutting edge thinking on a wide range of career coaching issues. MATERIAL Members may feel free to post questions, suggestions and requests for information. News about new approaches and resources is also welcome (but see our Rules on marketing material). Announcements aimed at the general public, for example job announcements or material promoting a coach's services to the buying public, will generally not be accepted. HOST AND MODERATOR John Lees, UK career strategist and author. MEMBERSHIP The Career Coach Forum accepts membership applications from practising career coaches in any part of the world. The term ""practising career coaches"" will be applied as flexibly as possible, and has to date been taken to include those in training to deliver career coaching, those who offer career development work as part of a broader remit, and experienced career coaches who are not seeing clients at the moment. The Forum is only open to individuals. It is a closed forum, with moderated posts only available to members. ETIQUETTE Like other groups on Linked In, the Forum has a strict policy on online bullying, including forceful and inappropriate language. The Career Coach Forum has limited tolerance for online promotion. Sales or promotional material which is also informative may be acceptable, but will otherwise be transferred to the Promotions section.

The Forum aims to be a space where careers specialists can exchange thinking on best practice, pass on news and information, ask questions and seek resources, and - above all else - share experiences and learning. The Forum aims to provide cutting edge thinking on a wide range of career coaching issues. MATERIAL Members may feel free to post questions, suggestions and requests for information. News about new approaches and resources is also welcome (but see our Rules on marketing material). Announcements aimed at the general public, for example job announcements or material promoting a coach's services to the buying public, will generally not be accepted. HOST AND MODERATOR John Lees, UK career strategist and author. MEMBERSHIP The Career Coach Forum accepts membership applications from practising career coaches in any part of the world. The term ""practising career coaches"" will be applied as flexibly as possible, and has to date been taken to include those in training to deliver career coaching, those who offer career development work as part of a broader remit, and experienced career coaches who are not seeing clients at the moment. The Forum is only open to individuals. It is a closed forum, with moderated posts only available to members. ETIQUETTE Like other groups on Linked In, the Forum has a strict policy on online bullying, including forceful and inappropriate language. The Career Coach Forum has limited tolerance for online promotion. Sales or promotional material which is also informative may be acceptable, but will otherwise be transferred to the Promotions section. See the Group Rules for more information. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3002424&goback=, group_name:-Web Professionals Connect, no_of_members:-49290, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/p/2/000/058/33b/30cce4c.png, group_id:-3002424, group_description:-This group exists to connect professionals of the following specialties: Web Applications Developer Web Developer Web Programmer Web Content Specialist Web Editor Web Project Manager Web Developer Graphic Designer Web Master Web Designer Flash Developer Web UI Developer *Spammers are not allowed to this group* <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=45320&goback=, group_name:-CHENNAI HR CLUB, no_of_members:-11425, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/p/1/000/063/1e2/0af233d.png, group_id:-45320, group_description:-CHENNAI HR CLUB is a community of HR experts and professionals to promote awareness, networking and informative discussions with one another.
