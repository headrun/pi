If you come across a great tool or a more efficient way of doing things, please share. If you are seeking advice, this is the place as well! To share a little bit of background, I started Marketeersclub.com with the intent of providing Product Managers with tools (primarily checklists and templates) to help them be more effective/efficient. How many times have you had to reinvent the wheel at the inception of a project/task? How do we, as mid and upper management professionals set aside time to think creatively when we are bogged down with the day-to-day execution? In every company I\'ve worked for, inevitably the following situations would come up: - Let\'s meet and figure out how to put together a marketing plan (or competitive battle plan, or other reporting). - Boss, what do you want us to include in the presentation for... - So we have 5 versions of competitive analysis (from 5 business units). Why? - Graphics, could we revise x, y and z because of oversight? What? #&@% My vision is to create a tight net group here so that we can make each other shine, globally! Are you in? I might start triggering conversations from time to time to. I do have a full time job, but this is my passion! I hope you\'ll join the force. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2884&goback=, group_name:-P&G Alumni Network - Global (Procter & Gamble), no_of_members:-30833, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAQ6AAAAJGE1MGMzYWI2LTkxNWMtNDA5Ny04MjIzLTM1N2U4Nzg4YzlmOA.png, group_id:-2884, group_description:-Welcome to the P&G Alumni Network Group.

We Import and Export because -	In some areas the local population cannot produce enough goods necessary for themselves. -	Some countries are more efficient at producing some things than others such as the export of cotton from the UK to the USA and Egypt. -	Various resources are only found in certain countries (China, UAE, Russia, US and Germany). -	One country may have a very poor balance of trade. -	Of the so called law of competitive advantage which means that, although two countries may produce the same goods, one country will be able to do it more cheaply than the other.

Employment Orientation Programme invites all individuals who share a vision of providing basic amenities to all the citizens of India. This can only be done by eradicating unemployment from this nation. We request individuals to join this group and share information about every job opportunity and make it reach the target audience, so that they can actually benefit from whatever little efforts we can make in improving their lives. In the process, if members are able to generate revenues by closing positions through networking, it only adds to the purpose of existence of this group. <> group_link:-https://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4893004&goback=, group_name:-Global Tread Hospitality Jobs, no_of_members:-172, group_logo:-https://media.licdn.com/media/p/5/005/059/25d/185457b.png, group_id:-4893004, group_description:-Global Tread is one of the world’s leading international global executive search firms specializing in identifying, evaluating and placing top hospitality talent from around the world.

If tasks were beyond his work knowledge, he would find information, try things and get it sorted. He owned up not just the task he was assigned, but the success of the project he was a part of. This clearly made him a bar raiser. He pushed his boundaries and influenced others to also always think about the \"better\" way of doing things; his work was almost never half baked, his PR comments were detailed and he always guided others towards doing the right thing, writing better code. He never contained himself to one stack. Whether it was android or iOS native projects or react native or complicated server side tasks, he\'d take them all as a challenge and delivered results.
